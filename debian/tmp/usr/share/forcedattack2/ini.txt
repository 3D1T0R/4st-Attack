This class reads and writes inifiles. Its really handy for saving settings
like sound and other user prefs. Because it aint a .py file u can use it
with something like py2exe and still have a userreadable settings system.
I also used it for implementing themes/skins in 4st Attack. Its quite easy
to do stuff like makin multires versions of a game based on locations u get
from a ini file.
